            <h4>Winter Equipment Brands that we recommend:</h4>
            <p>While it’s great to find ski rentals that are cheap and have good customer service, it’s also good to recognize which brands would work best for you. Sure, you could find your right size in every single brand, but that doesn’t determine if the quality is great. Check out our blog to see our monthly highlights for the best brands there are. Here are some brands that we have tried and recommend:</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 content-item" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-delay="100">
            <span>01</span>
            <h4>K2</h4>
            <p>Their skis and snowboards are top notch. They are used by professionals around the world and they have a great selection for beginners, intermediate and advanced. Their products are slightly pricey, but the quality of the skis and snowboards makes up for it and the shape of the skis makes it extremely easy to turn and to have good form. They also make boots, which fit with any brand of skis or snowboard, and have great ankle and foot support for a long day on the hills.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 content-item" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-delay="200">
            <span>02</span>
            <h4>Rossignal</h4>
            <p>Their shop sells everything, from skis and snowboards to goggles and helmets. They also have great deals in their shop, like free overnight shipping and thirty day returns. They have amazing guides for how to pick your ski/snowboard size, and also have many different sizes for shoes and colors for your skis. Their skis are also extremely high quality and can go on any terrain, including alpine.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 content-item" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-delay="300">
            <span>03</span>
            <h4>Line</h4>
            <p>They are an award-winning brand for their skis, however, they do not sell snowboarding gear, which is why they ranked lower on our list. They have a great selection of equipment including poles, bags and hats. They don’t have boots, but their skis pair perfectly to any other brand of boots. Their products are also pretty pricey, so we only recommend this brand for those who are more serious about skiing. However, their sleek and refined designs make it easy to go fast on the slopes.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 content-item" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-delay="400">
            <span>04</span>
            <h4>Fischer</h4>
            <p>These are also a more pricey ski and are mostly used for those who do alpine or nordic skiing. We also recommend these skis for more advanced skiers who are familiar with going off-track or onto ungroomed snow. Fischer also has really fun and beautiful designs that will instantly upgrade your skiing or snowboarding outfit, but due to the qualities mentioned above, we would not recommend them to beginners or kids who will grow out of their skis quickly. Fun fact: they also sell equipment for hockey!</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 content-item" data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-delay="500">
            <span>05</span>
            <h4>Volkl</h4>
            <p>This is a brand that everyone can use. Volkl also only sells skis, but they have a great selection for all skill levels and ages. They also have nordic skis for people who are more interested in hiking up and skiing down mountains. Their skis are not as expensive as some of the other top-notch brands and so are good for beginners who are looking to become serious skiers, and even kids who will grow out of their skis and boots after a few seasons. In addition to nordic and alpine skis, Volkl also sells poles and bags that are super useful on the slopes as well.</p>

              We here at WinteRent only want the best for our customers, so we recommend to look for these things when renting equipment:

            <div class="icon-box" data-aos="fade-up">
              <i class="bx bx-dollar"></i>
              <h4>Cost</h4>
              <p>Sometimes skis/snowboards can be so expensive, and we just can’t afford to pay hundreds of dollars for a single trip. Try to make sure to find ski stores with affordable costs, but also are great quality!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="icon-box" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
              <i class="bx bx-cube"></i>
              <h4>Shape</h4>
              <p>Make sure that there is good customer service at your rental place, because when looking for skis, you need to find the shape that matches you the best. Workers at these rentals can help you decide what shape or size to get based on your measurement and experience!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="icon-box" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
              <i class="bx bx-ruler"></i>
              <h4>Bindings</h4>
              <p>Again, customer service is important! You need to find the right bindings for your equipment, and that all depends on your personal measurements, age, experience etc. If you don’t have the right bindings that fit you, your safety could be at risk. Stay safe and find good bindings!</p>

              <h4 class="title"><a href="">Rent</a></h4>
              <p class="description">Skis and other equipment can be expensive and unnecessary if you only want to ski a few times each season, so a great alternative would be to rent skis for a couple of weeks to have a fun time on the slopes. Renting can still be expensive so make sure to explore your options.

              My boyfriend enjoys skiing, and for his birthday I wanted to get him new skis! However, I don't know anything about skiing. WinteRent helped find a store close to me, and helped me figure out a good brand to purchase! Thanks WinteRent!

              When my kid showed a sudden interest in skiing I was lost. I mean, we live in Florida? WinteRent helped me find the closest ski rental store that would have cheap skis. WinteRent ensured that my son would get his skis, even if he can't use them, and saved me from a huge meltdown from my son. Thanks.
