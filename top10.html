    <strong><p class="text">Top Brands:
Here are our top ten brands and why we suggest them:
 </p>
    <p class="text">1) K2: their skis and snowboards are top notch. They are used by professionals around the world and they have a great selection for beginners, intermediate and advanced. Their products are slightly pricey, but the quality of the skis and snowboards makes up for it. Their skis and snowboards can last for multiple seasons and can go on any terrain. They also make boots, which fit with any brand of skis or snowboard, and have great ankle and foot support for a long day on the hills.
  </p>
    <p class="text">2) Rossignol: their shop sells everything, from skis and snowboards to goggles and helmets. They also have great deals in their shop, like free overnight shipping and thirty day returns. They have amazing guides for how to pick your ski/snowboard size, and also have many different sizes for shoes and colors for your skis. Their skis are also extremely high quality and can go on any terrain, including alpine.
</p>
    <p class="text">3) Line: they are an award-winning brand for their skis, however, they do not sell snowboarding gear, which is why they ranked lower on our list. They have a great selection of equipment including poles, bags and hats. They don’t have boots, but their skis pair perfectly to any other brand of boots. Their products are also pretty pricey, so we only recommend this brand for those who are more serious about skiing. However, their sleek and refined designs make it easy to go fast on the slopes.
</p>
    <p class="text">4) Fischer: these are also a more pricey ski and are mostly used for those who do alpine or nordic skiing. We also recommend these skis for more advanced skiers who are familiar with going off-track or onto ungroomed snow. Fun fact: they also sell equipment for hockey!
</p>
<p class="text">5) Volkl: this is a brand that everyone can use. Volkl also only sells skis, but they have a great selection for all skill levels and ages. They also have alpine and nordic skis for people who are more interested in hiking up and skiing down mountains. In addition to nordic and normal skis, Volkl also sells poles and bags that are super useful on the slopes as well.
</p>
<p class="text">6) Salomon: this is another brand that everyone can use. They sell snowboards and snowboarding gear in addition to skiing gear, and accessories like bags and poles for your trip to the mountains. Their website also has reviews for their skis so you can make sure that the skis or snowboard that you’re getting is really worth the cost.
</p>
<p class="text">7) Armada: this brand does not sell snowboards, but their skis are generally more affordable than our other top brands. They only have a few select sizes that generally work for everyone, but if you are taller or shorter, you might have to opt for a different brand. They also sell bindings for your skis so that your skis will fit perfectly to your boots (which they do not sell).
</p>
<p class="text">8) Icelantic: this brand also does not sell snowboards, but their skis are beautifully made and have amazing designs. They also sell apparel like ski jackets and sweaters for the mountain so that you stay perfectly warm on your trip up the hills.
</p>
<p class="text">9) Atomic: this brand does not sell snowboards, but they have a wide variety of products for skiing, as well as apparel that can be worn or used by both snowboarders and skiers. They sell skis and ski boots, and ski poles, but they also have goggles, ski and snowboard protection and bags. All of their accessories are super affordable and high quality, as well as their skis and ski boots.
</p>
<p class="text">10) Lib Tech: they sell both skis and snowboards, both of which are super affordable. They also often hold sales in their online store. We recommend them because all of their apparel and accessories are eco-friendly and not too expensive. They also have a blog where you can check out reviews and stories about their products. Fun fact: they also sell surfboards and wakeboarding equipment!
</p>
<p class="text">We hope you find our list useful in purchasing or renting your next pair of skis or snowboard, and if you have any suggestions or brands that you think are better than these ones, please send us a suggestion using the Contact Us page!
